# RFD

This is an example repo for RFDs (Request for Discussion). Check out [RFD 0001](./text/0001) for details on how RFDs work.

Anyone can start an RFD to propose an idea they have and bring it to the rest of the team for discussion.

To start a new RFD, clone this repo, and run the following script

```bash
$ ./scripts/new.sh "My title here"
```
