# {TITLE}

## Summary

_What_ change are you proposing?

## Basic Example

If your proposal introduces a change to an existing library or API, provide a basic usage example of your proposed change.

## Motivation

- Why are we doing this?
- What business value does this add?
- What problem does this solve?

## Detailed Design

## Drawbacks

- Why should we _not_ do this?
- What risks does this pose?

## Alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior Art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- What have we tried in the past that has or hasn't worked?
- Are there any external resources that you consulted or that would provide useful context for this proposal?

## Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFD process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFD that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFD?

## Future Possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the language and project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the product and how it might fit into the work of other products.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFD you are writing but otherwise related.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFD; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFDs. The section merely provides additional information.
